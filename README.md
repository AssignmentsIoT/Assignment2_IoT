# Assignmet2_IoT

Hi everyone! This is the repository I'll use to keep all the code related to the second assignent of my IoT course at Sapienza.
You can find a detailed tutorial in the article I posted on Hackster.io: https://www.hackster.io/silvia-del-piano/environmental-stations-monitoring-system-with-mqtt-broker-8f755c .<br/>
To see everything in action check the video I posted on Youtube: link.<br/>
This work comes directly after the first assignment, so I suggest you have a look at my corresponding repo before.<br/>
## Summary
In a few words we want to build the architecture you can see in the PDF. We'll simulate the sensors using a program done with RIOT OS, set up the MQTT-SN broker using Mosquitto RSMB and build a bridge with Python that will forward the data to ThingsBoard IoT Platform.<br/>
All the relevant code can be foud here.<br/>
Have a nice day!
